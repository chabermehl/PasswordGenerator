# PasswordGenerator

Created this for fun to make quick and easy passwords for myself. It works by loading the words into a dictionary
from a `.json` file. I know better solutions exist, but I was bored.

## Usage

### Python Version:

`Python 3.7.0`

### Required Files:

`words_dictionary.json` for the words.

### To Run:

```
python password_generator.py
```

### Example Output:

`shptilexhockdaza`  
`murrshahstimaddu`  
`oradcolycawlheir`
